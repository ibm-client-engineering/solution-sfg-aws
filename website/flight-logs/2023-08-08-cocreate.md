## Work In Progress
- We continued to troubleshoot the SFTP Access issue. We began by trying to isolate the issue. We wanted to make sure WinSCP client wasn't causing any issues. So we made the customer try and connect using the command line. We got the same result where one partner connected and the new one didn't. 
- The customer showed us his passwords that hes using and they were identical except he added an extra number. So the password shouldn't be causing the issue. 
- We tried to edit the partner in the B2bi console however the ASI Pod was constantly restarting. After inspecting the logs we increased the startup probe timeout to 30. Due to the length of the startup when loading the jar files, we will check the status of the pod in tomorrow's session. 
  
## Tracking
- We will verify if increasing the startup probe timeout resolved the ASI pod restarting. 
- We will continue to look into the SFTP authentication issue and continue to troubleshoot in our next session.
