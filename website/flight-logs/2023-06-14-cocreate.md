## Work In Progress
- The KMS encryption with S3 is not currently supported and should be available by the end of the year or early next year. In the meantime, the team can focus on testing SFTP.
## Tracking
- Aneesh needs to set up an SFTP server and create an SFTP user with private keys for testing.
- Aneesh will speak to Gautam and Sara about getting an exception for S3 bucket storage to use standard AWS SSE instead of KMS.
