## Work In Progress
- Today we had another meeting with the support team and demoed the issue. 
- After investigation the team determined that a setting in the SFTP adapter was blocking subsequent users and partners from connecting.
- We suspect the issue is "Should the adapter be restricted to a certain group of users" is set to yes.
  
## Tracking
- We are going to alter this setting in the customer's environment and this should resolve the issue.
