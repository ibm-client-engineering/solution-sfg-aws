## Work In Progress
- The team continued to troubleshoot the AWS Signature error. The team first examined the configuration for the Business Process execution.
- The team then checked AWS S3 configuration and SSL and then reattempted to upload the file, but encountered the same error.
- The team then went through the logs to verify the details associated with the error.
## Tracking
- We noted the configurations currently being used in the Customer's environment, along with logs from the error. We will take this back to our Dev team and continue to troubleshoot this issue.
