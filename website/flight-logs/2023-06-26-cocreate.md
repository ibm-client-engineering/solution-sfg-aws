## Work In Progress
- Last Friday (6/23/23) the customer's team encountered an error while testing file transfer in Sterling.
- The error indicated a 400-status code, which typically means an invalid request from the client (Sterling) to the server (S3).
- The error message specifically mentions that requests specifying server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed keys require AWS Signature Version 4 and the S3 PUT service failed.
## Tracking
- Our team has opened a ticket (TS013430052) and are working closely with the Dev team to troubleshoot this issue.
