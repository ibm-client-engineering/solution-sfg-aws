## Work In Progress
- The team speculated that the DNS was not resolving and it could be a potential issue with AWS. The Customer said he would go back and work with his team on the issue.
- Our team would collaborate closely with the DEV team to effectively address and strategize the implementation of a KMS solution.
## Completed Today
- The team checked and validated the network policies.
- Curl attempt was made to RDS, but it could not resolve host.
## Issues & Challenges
- The team was troubleshooting a connection to the RDS Database. Does not appear that any changes were applied that would cause this problem and the connection problem started recently.
- After some discussion, the team learned that KMS is **mandatory** for all S3 buckets within the clients environment.
