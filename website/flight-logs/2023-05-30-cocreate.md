## Key Accomplishments
- We ran a helm chart update and it failed on the patched 2.1.1 since it was missing the pullsecret entry for the preinstall-tls job
- Applied series of patch commands in order to run the helm upgrade.
- Updated the helm chart to add an annotation for the pull-secret

## Challenges
- Received multiple errors during the helm upgrade

## Up Next
- Need to update patches for helm charts 2.1.1 to add pull secrets to preinstall-tls job container
- We need to get the business process set up to access S3
- Will need to update the service account entry in the overrides to the created S3 service account that has the role annotated.
- Aneesh will re-run the helm upgrade offline and we will check in on the next working session
