## Work In Progress
- For S3 KMS encryption support we are testing adding kms key permissions (kms:GenerateDataKey for upload/kms:Decrypt for get) to the role assigned via the service account.
- Waiting for Customer to complete a cluster upgrade and verify that RDS is accessible. <br></br>
  _**Customer followed up in an email stating they have upgraded the EKS cluster and SFG is up and running now._
## Issues & Challenges
- RDS access has been blocked at the DNS level. Customer was told that the AMIs used in the EKS cluster are now out of date and need to be upgraded
