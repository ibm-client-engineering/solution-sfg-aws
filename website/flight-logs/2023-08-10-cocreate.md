## Work In Progress
- Today we spoke with the support team regarding the SFTP access issue.
- We gave them information on our current status and deep dived into the ongoing issue.
- After the call the team worked within our reference environment and we were able to replicate the issue.
  
## Tracking
- Now that we have the issue replicated in our environment, we can reconvene and show the support team a demo of the issue.
- We will meet again with the support team and continue to work with them to troubleshoot this SFTP access issue.
