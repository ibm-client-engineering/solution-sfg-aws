## Work In Progress
- Today the team discussed the role and policy associated with the Service Account and the OIDC.
- We discussed the changes that were made to the policy and the trust relationship that enabled the AWS CLI image and B2Bi to have S3 access.
- The team was able to push a file to S3 from Sterling B2Bi and decided to try to work through other use cases.
- The team did encounter a ‚ÄúConnection Refused‚Äù error. The pod endpoints are not being propagated to the backend load balancer service and the Team is investigating.

## Tracking
- We will continue to examine the changes that were made that enabled the S3 connection and begin an RCA.
- The team will continue to troubleshoot and investigate the error.
