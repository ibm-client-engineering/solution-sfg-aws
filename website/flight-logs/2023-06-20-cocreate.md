## Work In Progress
- Pushing Towards Using an Accelerator: there was discussion on using an accelerator called Pragma Community Manager (PCM) to help prove out business use cases. It acts as an extra layer on top of B2B Integration (B2BI) and provides a single pane for managing operations. PCM acts as a one-stop-shop for setting up configurations and operations in File Gateway and the B2BI dashboard.
- There was a discussion on how the customer primarily uses S3 for file transfers. S3 buckets are encrypted with KMS keys for security.
## Tracking
- The the customer team requested documentation related to S3 and the currently supported features.
- Our team requested a bucket that had a policy that didnâ€™t force KMS to be passed in the header.
- The customer requested a follow up working session to further discuss and test S3 buckets with KMS encryption and policies.
