## Key Accomplishments

- Successfully applied AWS role and policy to allow access to S3 buckets in our reference env.
- Successfully demoed Sterling Secure Proxy
- Introduced customer team to new Document site
- Updated the ALB idle timeout in the ingress annotations in the overrides
  - Verified in our reference environment that this solves a Gateway 403 error when running an S3 business process and updated our documentation. [PR#37](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-sfg-aws/pull/37)
  - Updated the customer's ingress annotations in their overrides and applied to their environment
- Was able to verify with the customer that the following were configured and enabled:
  - OIDC provider assigned to cluster
  - IAM policy for S3 configured for their test bucket
  - Service account was created in the cluster
  - IAM policy was attached to the appropriate role created
  - Service account in cluster was annotated with the role.

## Up Next

- Build a Business Process that uploads a file to the S3 bucket and verify the file was successfully uploaded.
