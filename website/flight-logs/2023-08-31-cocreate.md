## Work in Progress
- The team help troubleshoot an authentication issue when transferring files from the mainframe to SFG. It appears the casing on the partnerâ€™s name was being changed from lower case to upper case.
- The team thinks that this was being done on the mainframe side. They created a new uppercase partner for testing and viewed documentation on it.
