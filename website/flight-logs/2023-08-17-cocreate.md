## Work in Progress
- The team was able to resolve the issue that blocked newly created SFTP partners from connecting to the SFTP server.
- The setting in the SFTP adapter "Should the adapter be restricted to a certain group of users" was set to "yes" and this was causing the connection issue.
- The team setup new SFTP partners and were able to push files to the SFTP server and complete the SFTP use case.
## Currently Tracking
- The team is preparing to move forward with the mainframe use case.
## Next Steps
- We are closing out the case TS013825812 since the issue has been resolved. 
- The customer said they would reach out to the mainframe team and see if they could join tomorrowâ€™s call.
- Team is preparing to move forward with the S3 Cross account use case Monday.
