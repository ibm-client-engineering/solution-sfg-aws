## Work in Progress
- Today the team was able to resolve the AWS credentials error. It appears restarting the pod resolved the issue. The team was able to push a file from S3 to a mainframe and complete the use case.
## Currently Tracking
- The customer is continuing to work with his team to implement and test the S3 cross account solution.
- The team discussed upcoming use cases such as SFTP get then route S3, CD z/OS push 150GB file to S3, and S3 Get 150GB file push to CD z/OS.
- The team is planning to have members from the mainframe team on Wednesday (8/30) session.
## Next Steps
- The team will continue to move forward and complete new use cases.
