## Work In Progress
- Today the team continued to discuss the ‚ÄúOIDC Not Found‚Äù error.
- The Customer got feedback on the signature issue from AWS and the team discussed the response.
- AWS provided some suggested documentation on the matter:
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingAWSSDK.html#specify-signature-version
- We checked the Customer's environment and verified an S3 endpoint exists.

## Tracking
- Currently the customer is working with his team to implement the appropriate role, policy, and OIDC within the correct AWS account.
