## Work In Progress
- The team discussed issues related to connecting to S3 buckets across different AWS accounts.
- The team was not able to connect to a new S3 bucket using SFG, even though the configuration was set up similar to a working bucket.
- The team discussed the need to research AWS documentation regarding cross-account connectivity and chained assume role operations.
  
## Tracking
- The team planned to continue to investigate why SFG was not working with the new bucket and how to configure it to access multiple buckets in different accounts.
