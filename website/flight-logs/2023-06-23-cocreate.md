## Work In Progress
- The team discussed the need to attach the KMS key to the access policy for S3.
- The customer's team noted that having ‚ÄúBucket Key‚Äù enabled will generate a key, instead of fetching one.
- When setting the S3 bucket, we encountered issues with updating the policy document and encountered unsupported property policy documents error.
- We attempted to troubleshoot the issue by creating a new role and policy, but the problem persisted.
- It was suggested to remove the KMS actions and see if the policy update is successful without them.
## Tracking
- The customer's team said they would continue to debug and troubleshoot the error and we would reconvene next week.
