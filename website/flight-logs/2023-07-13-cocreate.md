## Work In Progress
- Today the team discussed the OIDC and the new error that occurred after the OIDC was setup in the correct AWS account.
- here was an ‚ÄúAccess Denied when calling the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity‚Äù error.
- The Customer said he added this error to the ticket he has with AWS.

## Tracking
- We are going to research the error while awaiting feedback on the open ticket with AWS.
