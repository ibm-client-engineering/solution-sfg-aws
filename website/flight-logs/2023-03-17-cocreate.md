## Key Accomplishments

- Adjusting resource quotas for AC and ASI for the namespace
- Max hard quotas have been bumped up to 32G for memory, 20 for CPU
- namespace quota is for all pods not per pod, so we doubled the numbers and applied
- Delete the deployment and adjust the overrides to disable dbsetup (assuming db was successfully configured)
- Applied the secret name for each ingress that was generated by the tls job. This is temporary as they should be able to get their certs via an annotation once itâ€™s available
- Nodes appeared to scale up, need to see the events log
