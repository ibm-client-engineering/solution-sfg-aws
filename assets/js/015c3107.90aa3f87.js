In this example the role is within the same account that the EKS cluster is in. However, this role can be setup in any AWS account. Now that our B2Bi pod using a service account is associated with an AWS IAM role, we can now begin to assign permissions to that role. Because of the way IAM permissions work across accounts, we will need to add permissions to the role and we will also need to add a resource-based policy that allows the IAM role to use the bucket-key pair. Keep in mind that KMS keys can be used on multiple buckets. So, while you need to modify the resource-based policy for every S3 bucket since they are unique, you may have to modify a lesser number of KMS key resource-based policies since they can be shared across buckets. So in total, we will need to add policies to the iam role, the bucket, and the kms key. This will allow B2Bi to access KMS encrypted S3 Buckets in different accounts.

If the EKS cluster and KMS S3 buckets are all in the same account, you can still follow this guide. However, instead of using resource-based policies, you can assign policies directly to the IAM role since you don't have to access resources across different accounts.
