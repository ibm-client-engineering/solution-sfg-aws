The error mentions an issue with the signature version being used. It is noted that AWS deprecated older signature versions, and the SDK should default to using version 4 signatures. The discussion speculates if the SDK version might be a factor in the error.\\n\\nThe following troubleshooting steps were taken in our IBM reference environment:\\n- We examined the IAM policy and configurations.\\n- We logged into to B2Bi and checked which version of the AWS SDK was being used.\\n- Logged into the cluster and checked to be sure a token was being obtained.\\n- Downgraded environment to 6.1.2.1 and we are still not encountering the issue.\\n## Tracking\\n- Our team is continuing to work closely with the Dev team to troubleshoot this issue.\\n\\n- **Cases open: 1**\\n  - Case TS013430052\\n- **Cases closed: 5**\\n  - case TS012906539\\n  - case TS013042929\\n  - case TS012831699\\n  - case TS012704616\\n  - case TS012702956  \\n- [ibm-client-engineering/solution-sfg-aws#17](https://zenhub.ibm.com/workspaces/st5-action-information-center-64343620d0cfd0000f03a114/issues/ibm-client-engineering/solution-sfg-aws/17)\\n- This flight log is being submitted via PR \\"06/28/2023 Documentation\\"."},{"id":"flight-log-22","metadata":{"permalink":"/solution-sfg-aws/blog/flight-log-22","editUrl":"https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-sfg-aws/edit/main/website/flight-logs/2023-06-27-cocreate.md","source":"@site/flight-logs/2023-06-27-cocreate.md","title":"Log - Sprint 22 \ud83d\udeeb","description":"Flight Log of Co-Creation Activities","date":"2023-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 27, 2023","tags":[{"label":"log","permalink":"/solution-sfg-aws/blog/tags/log"},{"label":"sprint","permalink":"/solution-sfg-aws/blog/tags/sprint"}],"readingTime":0.685,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Log - Sprint 22 \ud83d\udeeb","description":"Flight Log of Co-Creation Activities","slug":"flight-log-22","tags":["log","sprint"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Log - Sprint 23 \ud83d\udeeb","permalink":"/solution-sfg-aws/blog/flight-log-23"},"nextItem":{"title":"Log - Sprint 21 \ud83d\udeeb","permalink":"/solution-sfg-aws/blog/flight-log-21"}},"content":"## Work In Progress\\n- The team continued to troubleshoot the AWS Signature error.
