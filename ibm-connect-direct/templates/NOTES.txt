Post helm installation steps.

1. Wait for the pod to become ready. You can keep track of the pods either through the dashboard or through the command line interface: 
	kubectl get pods -l release={{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -o wide

   From the output of above command, verify the STATUS as "Running".

2. To view the service and ports exposed in pod.
	kubectl get svc -l release={{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -o wide
  
   From the output of above command, view the external IP and exposed ports under EXTERNAL-IP 
   and PORT(S) column respectively and use them for communication. If external LoadBalancer is 
   not present refer Master node IP as external IP.
